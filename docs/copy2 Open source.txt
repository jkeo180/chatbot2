OPEN SOURCE 
Cool question. Since you’re already into coding, AI, robotics and space topics — there *are* open-source space projects out there that are roughly at or just above your current skill level. Some are beginner-friendly, others will stretch you (in a good way). If you wanted to start contributing, build skills, or just tinker 👉 here are a few I’d check out **right now** if I were you.

## 🚀 Open-source space / astronomy / robotics projects worth your time

| Project                                                                      | What it covers / Why it’s good for you                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Orbiter Space Flight Simulator**                                           | A realistic spaceflight simulator published under MIT license — you can modify physics, add custom spacecraft or planets, play with orbital mechanics. Great for learning fundamentals of spaceflight, gravity, and simulation programming. ([Wikipedia][1]) |
| **Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP)**                                               | Used to create terrain and 3D models from planetary and satellite images. Good if you like mapping, geometry, planetary surfaces (Mars, Moon, etc.) — intersects with data processing + geospatial coding. ([Wikipedia][2])                                  |
| **REBOUND**                                                                  | N-body physics simulator — handles gravitational dynamics, collisions, orbital simulations. Helps you build intuition for celestial mechanics, orbital dynamics, even asteroid / ring simulations. ([arXiv][3])                                              |
| **HNSKY** (Hallo Northern Sky)                                               | Open-source planetarium / sky-chart + celestial simulator. More “astronomy-lite,” but good for playing with star maps, constellations, and potentially integrating observational data or building astronomy-tools. ([Wikipedia][4])                          |
| **TART Radio Telescope (or at least its software stack)**                    | A low-cost open-source radio-telescope project. If you ever want to mix hardware (like maybe a Raspberry Pi, antennas) + software + coding — this is a great blend of physical DIY and astrophysics. ([Wikipedia][5])                                        |
| **Popular open-source Earth & space data tools from NASA / community repos** | NASA releases a huge amount of data & open-source code. Good for “citizen-scientist” style work — data analysis, visualization, remote sensing, astrophysics, etc. ([NASA][6])                                                                               |

## 🎯 Which ones match your skill + interest right now

Since you are already working on AI, computer vision, robotics — the sweet spot is projects that mix **space + simulation + data processing + coding**. That means ASP, REBOUND, Orbiter, TART stand out as especially good fits. They challenge you technically, but aren’t so advanced that you’d be lost.

Also, if you want to stretch yourself — maybe a data-pipeline with NASA’s open data + some ML/vision tools would be a powerful combo.

## 🔧 How I’d start if I were you (and you like space + coding)

1. **Pick one project** — e.g. Orbiter or REBOUND.
2. Clone it, build locally, run a simple example.
3. Tinker: change a parameter, simulate a different planet, or add a simple script (Python, if supported).
4. Document what you changed: commit to GitHub + log what you learned (this helps future employers see you’re serious).
5. If you like it — try to add a **small feature** or fix a bug. That’s how you move from “user” to “contributor.”

If you want, I can **pull up 5–10 more open-source space-projects right now**, with direct GitHub URLs, **ranked by relative difficulty** (easy → hard).
That way you can pick which fits your time / energy level best without overshooting or underwhelming yourself.
